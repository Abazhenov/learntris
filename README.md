Learntris 2
===========

Learntris is a project started for the [/r/learnprogramming](http://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming) community, to let developers learn to make a game like Tetris in a test-driven way. Learntris provides a test harness and a simple console-based protocol that makes it easy to check if you're going in the right direction, and that your implementation is correct.

Learntris 2 was intended to replace the [original Learntris](https://github.com/LearnProgramming/learntris), given its clunkiness and limitations.

Usage
==========

Run `python learntris2.py path_to_your_executable_implementation`. It should display tests that pass or fail. If something goes wrong, read the error provided. If something is *very* wrong, file an issue on GitHub or seek support at `#learnprogramming` on [Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/), or at [/r/learnprogramming](http://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming).
